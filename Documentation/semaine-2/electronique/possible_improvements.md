# Possible Improvements - BlackBox & Control Station

The "BlackBox & Control Station" system is functional and fulfills its initial objectives. However, several avenues for improvement can be explored to enhance its capabilities, robustness, and user-friendliness.

### 1. BlackBox Module Enhancements

* **Advanced EEPROM Management**: Implement more sophisticated EEPROM circular buffer management to ensure data integrity even in case of power loss during writing, or to add timestamps to records.
* **Additional Data Acquisition**: Integrate other sensors (GPS for crash location, barometer for altitude, temperature/humidity sensor) to enrich flight data.
* **Power Consumption Optimization**: Implement low-power modes to extend the BlackBox's battery life, essential for embedded applications.
* **Crash Detection Accuracy**: Refine the crash detection algorithm using filtering techniques (Kalman filter, complementary filter) for the MPU-6050, or by integrating dynamic thresholds.

### 2. Control Station Module Enhancements

* **Enriched User Interface**: Replace the LCD screen with an OLED or TFT graphic display for richer output (graphs, intuitive menus, icons).
* **Received Data Storage**: Add an SD card or external EEPROM so the Control Station can record a history of received real-time data, not just post-crash.
* **Extended Connectivity**:
    * Integration of a Wi-Fi (ESP8266/ESP32) or Bluetooth module for wireless communication with a PC or smartphone, allowing more advanced visualization or remote transmission.
    * Set up an embedded web server on the ESP32 to visualize data via a browser.
* **Audio/Visual Alerts**: Add a buzzer or LEDs for more visible or audible alerts in case of a crash.

### 3. Communication and Robustness Enhancements

* **Checksum/CRC for I2C**: Add an error checking mechanism (checksum or CRC) to I2C packets to ensure the integrity of transmitted data.
* **Sensor Redundancy**: For critical applications, consider using multiple sensors and data fusion logic for greater reliability.
* **Casing and Mounting**: Design and 3D-print a robust and compact casing for each module, protecting the electronics and facilitating integration into a drone/robot.
* **FOTA (Firmware Over-The-Air) Updates**: If Wi-Fi connectivity is added, enable remote firmware updates to facilitate maintenance and evolution.
